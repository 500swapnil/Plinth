# Quick Start

## Installing Plinth

Unzip and untar the source into a directory.  Change to the directory
containing the program.  Run `./plinth.py` and point your web
browser at `localhost:8000`.  The default username is "admin" and the
default password is "secret".

## Dependencies

* cherrypy - python web engine v3+

* cheetah - Debian has python-cheetah package

* python - tested with version 2.6.6

* *GNU Make* is used to build the templates and such.

The documentation has some dependencies too.

* *Markdown* is used to format and style docs.

* *Pandoc* converts the markdown to different formats.

* *PDFLatex* generates pdf versions of the documentation.

* *GNU Make* processes /doc/Makefile.

## Building the Documentation

Documentation has been collected into a pdf that can be built using
`make doc`.  It also gets built into smaller files and other formats,
including one suitable for install as a man page.
