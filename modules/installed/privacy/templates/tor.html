<p>Tor is an anonymous communication system. You can learn more about
it from the <a href="https://www.torproject.org/">Tor Project</a>
website. For best protection when web surfing, the Tor Project
recommends that you use
the <a href="https://www.torproject.org/download/download-easy.html.en">Tor
Browser Bundle</a>.</p>

<p>A Tor SOCKS port is available on your FreedomBox on TCP port
9050.</p>

<p>Your FreedomBox is configured as a Tor bridge with obfsproxy, so it
can help circumvent censorship. If your FreedomBox is behind a router
or firewall, you should make sure the following ports are open, and
port-forwarded, if necessary:</p>

<table class="table table-bordered table-condensed span2">
  {% for name, port in tor_ports.items %}
    <tr>
      <td>{{ name }}</td>
      <td>{{ port }}</td>
    </tr>
  {% endfor %}
</table>
