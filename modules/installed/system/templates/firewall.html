<p>Firewall is a network security system that controls the incoming
and outgoing network traffic on your {{ cfg.box_name }}. Keeping a
firewall enabled and properly configured reduces risk of security
threat from the Internet.</p>

<p>The following the current status:</p>

{% if firewall_status = 'not_installed' %}
<p>Firewall is not installed. Please install it. Firewall comes
pre-installed with {{ cfg.box_name }}. On any Debian based system
(such as {{ cfg.box_name }}) you may install it using the command 'aptitude
install firewalld'</p>

{% elif firewall_status = 'not_running' %}

<p>Firewall daemon is not running. Please run it. Firewall comes
enabled by default on {{ cfg.box_name }}. On any Debian based system
(such as {{ cfg.box_name }}) you may run it using the command 'service
firewalld start' or in case of a system with systemd 'systemctl start
firewalld'</p>

{% else %}

<ul>

  {% for service in services %}
  <li>{{ service.name }}:
    {% if service.is_enabled %}
    <span class='firewall-permitted'>Enabled</span>
    {% else %}
    <span class='firewall-blocked'>Disabled</span>
    {% endif %}

    <ul>
      {% for port in service.ports %}
      <li> {{ port }}:
        {% if port in internal_enabled_services and port in external_enabled_services %}
