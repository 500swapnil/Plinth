<p>File explorer for users that also have shell accounts.</p> <p>Until
that is written (and it will be a while), we should
install <a href="http://www.mollify.org/demo.php">mollify</a>
or <a href="http://www.ajaxplorer.info/wordpress/demo/">ajaxplorer</a>,
but of which seem to have some support for playing media files in the
browser (as opposed to forcing users to download and play them
locally).  The downsides to third-party explorers are: they're don't
fit within our theme system, they require separate login, and they're
written in php, which will make integrating them hard.</p>

<p>There are, of course, many other options for php-based file
explorers.  These were the ones I saw that might do built-in media
players.</p>

<p>For python-friendly options, check out <a
href="http://blogfreakz.com/jquery/web-based-filemanager/">FileManager</a>.
It appears to be mostly javascript with some bindings to make it
python-friendly.</p>
