# Introduction

## Name

[Plinth](https://wiki.debian.org/FreedomBox/Plinth) - a web front end for administering [FreedomBox](https://freedomboxfoundation.org/)

## Description

[FreedomBox](https://freedomboxfoundation.org/) is a community project to develop, design and promote
personal servers running free software for private, personal
communications.  It is a networking appliance designed to allow
interfacing with the rest of the Internet under conditions of
protected privacy and data security.  It hosts applications such as
blog, wiki, website, social network, email, web proxy and a Tor relay
on a device that can replace your Wi-Fi router so that your data stays
with you.

[Plinth](https://wiki.debian.org/FreedomBox/Plinth) is a web interface to administer the functions of the
[FreedomBox](https://freedomboxfoundation.org/).  It is extensible and provides various applications of
[FreedomBox](https://freedomboxfoundation.org/) as modules.  Each module or application provides simplified
user interface to control the underlying functionality.  As [FreedomBox](https://freedomboxfoundation.org/)
can act as a wireless router, it is possible to configure networking
from [Plinth](https://wiki.debian.org/FreedomBox/Plinth).  [Plinth](https://wiki.debian.org/FreedomBox/Plinth) also allows configuration of basic system
parameters such as time zone, hostname and automatic upgrades.
