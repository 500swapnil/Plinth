series of Debian packages that configure a plug computer to behave as
a Freedom Plug.

### On what hardware is the Freedom Plug based?

The current targets are the [Guru Plug](http://guruplug) and the

## Accessing the Freedom Plug

### Why does ssh listen on port 2222 instead of 22?

If ssh listens on port 2222, bots and scripts will forever attempt to
guess your username and password.  Maybe your password isn't so
strong.  Maybe the bots get lucky.  Either way, if you allow ssh
access on port 22, you're taking a chance that can be avoided quite
easily by moving your ssh activity to a slightly more obscure port.

Because ssh activity on these boxes will be limited to programs
configured to work specifically with Freedom Plugs as well relatively
few people generally using ssh, the coordination necessary to use a
non-standard port is easily achieved.
